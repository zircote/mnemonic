## Research Query

> Academic validation, strategic planning, and feature roadmap research for mnemonic - a filesystem-based memory system for AI coding assistants.

## Configuration

| Setting | Value |
|---------|-------|
| Decision Context | Academic validation, strategic planning, and feature roadmap for mnemonic |
| Target Audience | Product team, technical team, open source community, executives |
| Geographic Scope | Global |
| Time Horizon | Near-term |
| Priority Areas | Filesystem-based approaches, emerging trends, academic foundations |

## Artifacts

- [Research State](./state.json) - Elicitation context, findings, and sources
- [Full Research Report](./2026-01-24-research.md) - Detailed research findings

## Key Findings

1. **Letta benchmark validates filesystem approach**: 74.0% accuracy vs Mem0's 68.5% on LoCoMo benchmark - filesystem-based memory outperforms specialized vector/graph tools
2. **Unix philosophy for AI is academically validated**: Arxiv paper confirms collapsing interfaces into file abstraction is proven strategy for managing complexity
3. **MCP adoption is massive**: 8M+ downloads, 16,000+ servers - MCP integration essential for ecosystem compatibility
4. **Market gap exists**: Cursor and Windsurf lack native persistent memory; community uses markdown file workarounds that validate mnemonic's approach
5. **Cognitive memory types are industry standard**: Semantic, episodic, procedural classification aligns with emerging AI agent architectures

## Surprising Insights

- Simplicity correlates with reliability: LLMs use filesystem tools more effectively than novel retrieval mechanisms
- GitHub Copilot's new memory uses citation-based validation - mnemonic's provenance tracking aligns with industry direction
- Iterative querying transforms retrieval into exploration - agents generate own queries and refine searches

## Feature Opportunities (Preserving Filesystem Simplicity)

1. **MCP Server** - Expose memories via MCP for cross-tool compatibility
2. **Citation Validation** - Add optional code citations that can be verified against codebase
3. **Memory Summarization** - Auto-compress memories for context window efficiency
4. **Multi-Agent Coordination** - Extend blackboard pattern for agent-to-agent memory sharing
