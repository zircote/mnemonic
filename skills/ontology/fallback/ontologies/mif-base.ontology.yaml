# Cognitive Triad Namespace Hierarchy
#
# Three top-level namespaces based on memory types:
# - semantic: Facts, concepts, relationships (declarative knowledge)
# - episodic: Events, experiences, timelines (autobiographical memory)
# - procedural: Step-by-step processes (skill-based knowledge)
#
# Each top-level has sub-namespaces for organization.
# Path format: {top-level}/{sub-namespace}
# Example: semantic/decisions, episodic/incidents, procedural/runbooks
