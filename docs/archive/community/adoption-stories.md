## Example Story

### From Cursor Memory Bank to Multi-Tool Workflow

**Author:** Anonymous
**Setup:** Solo developer, Cursor + Claude Code, web development
**Migrated from:** Cursor Memory Bank

#### Challenge

I had built up a great Memory Bank setup in Cursor over 6 months. Hundreds of patterns, decisions, and learnings. But I wanted to try Claude Code for some tasks, and starting from scratch felt wasteful.

#### Solution

Used the migration tool to convert my Memory Bank files to MIF format. Now the same memories work in both tools. I use Cursor for frontend work and Claude Code for backend—same context everywhere.

#### Results

- Migration took about 20 minutes
- Zero memory loss
- Now using 3 different AI tools with the same knowledge base
- Validation caught 2 malformed memories I hadn't noticed

#### Tips

- Don't try to migrate everything at once—start with your most-used decisions
- The validation tool is your friend—run it after migration
- Keep your old Memory Bank files around for a few weeks, just in case
