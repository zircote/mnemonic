## Why Community Matters

Mnemonic exists because the community showed the need. Memory Bank projects in Cursor and Windsurf forums validated that:

1. Developers want persistent AI memory
2. Filesystem-based approaches work well
3. Markdown is the right format
4. Cross-tool compatibility matters

Mnemonic builds on this foundation with standardization, validation, and multi-tool support.
